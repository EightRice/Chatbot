So this is a chatbot I am working on.  I am working on right now actually training it on a BUNCH of reddit data.
However nothing with the reddit data is done yet, just working on converting it to a format so that I can use it for the chatbot

In this repo I have a chatbot that IS working which is the main.py and predict.py.  This uses the intents.json file, which you can check out.

I also have another chatbot that I'm working on(the reddit one) which you can see what i have so far at the usingRedditData.py.

Also, some credit to techwithtim and sentdex, got a few ideas from them.
